# The `ChangeHistory` user command

⍝⍝ ## The GUI

⍝⍝ ### Main GUI

⍝⍝ After executing the `]ChangeHistory` user command you get this main GUI:

⍝⍝ ![](MainGui.png "ChangeHistory's main GUI")

⍝⍝ Along the version that was committed to Git all changes made thereafter are available for comparison.

⍝⍝ ### The "Process" GUI

⍝⍝ You can then either process a single file via its context menu of select several rows and then select the "Process..." 
⍝⍝ command from the "Edit" menu.

⍝⍝ That results in this window:

⍝⍝ ![](ProcessGui.png "The ''Process'' GUI")

⍝⍝You can compare the two versions marked with active radio buttons. For that it is recommended that you have installed 
⍝⍝ BeyondCompare on your computer.
                               
⍝⍝ `]ChangeHistory` relies on all changes being written to component files; for each APL object a separate DCF is created. 
⍝⍝ The "Process" option lists all changes but also the latest committed version to Git.


## Tell acre

You need to make sure that acre calls the function `OnAfterSave` (which belongs to `ChangeHistory`) so that every single
change will be written to the `change_history/` folder in the correct project folder.

This can be achieved in a number of ways.

### Temporarily

For that it's enough to call 

```
      ]ChangeHistory -install
```

This will establish a function `OnAfterSave` in `⎕SE` where acre can find and execute it.

Naturally when you `)OFF` that instance of Dyalog it's gone.

### Permanently

After establishing `OnAfterSave` in `⎕SE` you could save the DSE (read: the session file). That makes it permanent, but
only for that version of APL.

Alternatively you could create a script file `setup.dyalog` within `%USERPROFILE%/Documents/MyUCMDs` and have a `Run`
function in that script that in turn somehow brings the code of the `OnAfterSave` function into `⎕SE`. This `Run` function
would be automatically executed whenever an instance of Dyalog is started. 

This would make it permanent for all versions of Dyalog. At the time of writing this would be true for 16.0, 17.0 and
17.1.

You also have to make sure that acre actually calls `OnAfterSave` after it having saved any change. 

In order to achieve that execute `]acre.AfterSave ⎕SE.OnAfterSave`. This will make sure that the function `⎕SE.OnAfterSave` will be 
executed in all your acre projects. However, once you `)OFF` that's vanished.

If you want `OnAfterSave` only be executed within particular projects you should modify the file `acre.config`. See the acre
documentation for details.

If you prefer to activate `ChangeHistory`in all your acre projects _permanently_ then you need to create a script file 
`setup.dyalog` within `%USERPROFILE%/Documents/MyUCMDs` and have a `Run` function that performs the necessary actions.


### Discarding the history

All the pieces of information written to the component files become obsolete once you perform the next "Commit". It is 
therefore recommended that you discard the directory `change_history/` (which contains nothing but those component files), 
straight after the Commit. 

It is also recommended that you do this under program control.

However, you can also discard the `change_history/` folder by calling the user command with the `-discard` option:

```
     ]ChangeHistory -discard
```
