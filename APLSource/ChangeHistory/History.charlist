* 1.0.1 ⋄ 2020-02-18
  * Bug fixes:
    * In case an object was changed just once the user was prevented from comparing that changed version with the Git version.
    * +/List.SelItems is occasionally 0 although a row was selected. Now a function checks and returns a 1 in such cases.
* 1.0.0 ⋄ 2020-02-15
  * Very first version
